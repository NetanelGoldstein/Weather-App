        <p>This website was designed as a semester project at Frostburg State University, Summer 2022.</p>
        <p>The weather data is retrieved using the <a href ="https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/timeline-weather-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Timeline Weather API </a> from Visual Crossing.</p>
        <p> This site allows users to easily query a range of years with one click, instead of having to enter a seperate API call for each year.</p>    
        <p> The energy data is from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The data is accessed through their <a href="https://www.eia.gov/opendata/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Open Data </a> API.
